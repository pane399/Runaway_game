Made Obstacle's moving system. It's speed must be stablized, Even if player step on it.
Now we need to make pulling objects to manage obstacles.

## 21.02.03
Edited Obstacle's moving system and collider system. When player jumps, collider would be diabled and would be enabled again if player lands on the obstacle. <br>
Now I have to make spawning point and manager for obstacles.
